# Project Overview

This is a project to test a feedReader code in Jasmine.js with JQuery to select DOM elements. [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)

The project code base is from Udacity.


## How to run the app locally

- click "clone or download" on upper right corner
- choose "Download zip"
- Unzip the file
- Open index.html using your browser, you should be able to see the feeds load.


## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.

Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
